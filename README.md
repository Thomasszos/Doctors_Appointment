SCRUM Project: Creating an application to manage doctors appointments.

Doctors Appointment 
The Doctors Appointment Software is an application meant for both Patients and doctors where the patients will have access to see their prescription, and doctors can set up appointments and they can see who they are visiting and send them their prescription information. This application will feature user friendly UI for the patients aiming towards Senior citizens or patients with a disability. Users will create their own account, accept terms and conditions and be assigned to their intended role as doctor or patient. The platform will provide brief instructions, interactivity. By developing this software we aspire to create something that can help the sick and those whose job is to help the sick.
